# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `# 1`
> Scenario selected: Investigation into high-turnover rate by Human Resource Department.

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
write your answer here...
```The purpose of the survey is to identify the drivers of high turnover rate specifically among entry- and lower-level positions. The study attempts to achieve the objective by measuring job satisfaction, growth-opportunity perception and work-life balance expectation. The department intends to use this data to implement any policy changes to increase employee retention.

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
write your answer here...
``` 1) Target population: All current employees at entry- and lower-level positions across all departments and employees who resigned in recent months.
2) Sampling frame: Internal employee directory filtered to entry- and lower-level positions and recently exited employees.
3) Sampling Units: Individual employees at entry- and lower-level positions
4) Overall sampling strategy: Stratified random sampling – divide the entire entry- and lower-level positioned employee list by departments (so as to get accurate data from all departments) – stratification, and then randomly select participants from each ‘strata’ to rule out bias.


Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. write your question here... 1) On scale of 1 to 3, how happy are you with your current salary and benefits – 1 = Below expectations, 2 = As expected, 3 = Exceeds expectations
2. write your question here... 2) How often are you able to manage your workload withing working hours – 1 = Never; 2 = Sometimes; 3= Most of the time; 4 = Always
3. write your question here... 3) How satisfied are you with the career advancement and growth opportunities within the company – 1 = Not satisfied; 2 = Some what satisfied; 3 = Satisfied; 4 = Extremely Satisfied
4. write your question here... 4) How often do you find support from your supervisor in terms of constructive criticism and overall growth - 1 = Never; 2 = Sometimes; 3= Most of the time; 4 = Always
5. write your question here... 5) On scale of 1 to 3, how would you rate your work-life balance - 1 = Below expectations, 2 = As expected, 3 = Exceeds expectations
6. write your question here... 6) How often do you feel your contribution is valued by upper management - 1 = Never; 2 = Sometimes; 3= Most of the time; 4 = Always
7. write your question here... 7) Select all that apply – factors that caused you to consider leaving the company – 1 = lack of remote work; 2 = insufficient growth prospects; 3 = inadequate support from management; 4 = inadequate work-life balance; 5 = better offer (compensation) from competitor company.
8. write your question here... (optional)
9. write your question here... (optional)
10. write your question here... (optional)
```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
write your answer here
``` 1)	Sample type: Cross-sectional probability sampling using stratified design. Ten provinces were divided into geographic strata (Census Metropolitan Areas and non-CMAs).
2)	Sample size: Field sample was approximately 50,000 units and expected completion target was 24,000 questionnaires. The actual final number of completed responses used for the PUMF (Public Use Microdata File) typically aligns with this national target.
3)	Target population: Non-institutionalized persons aged 15 years and older living in the 10 provinces of Canada. It excludes residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, full-time residents of institutions and residents of First Nations reserves.
4)	Sampling frame: A hybrid frame derived from the Statistics Canada Address Register, supplemented by administrative data (e.g., tax files) to ensure coverage and contact information.
5)	Survey mode(s): Multi-mode approach - Electronic Questionnaire (EQ) as the primary mode, supplemented by Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) for follow-ups and non-respondents.
6)	Timeline: Data collection occurred from September 4, 2018, to December 28, 2018. The reference period for most activities was the 12 months preceding the interview date and the primary results and public microdata were released in early 2021.
7)	Response rate: Statistics Canada does not publish the exact response rate in the public summary which is usually reported in the methodology section of the user guide (often as a percent of the eligible sample). It would reflect the proportion of selected households/individuals who responded, but the specific response rate for that cycle is listed as not available in the summary table of General Social Survey (GSS), including Cycle 33 (2018: Giving, Volunteering and Participating).
8)	Weights: Data includes design weights and person-level weights. These weights account for the probability of selection, household size (since only one person per household is selected), and are adjusted for non-response and post-stratification to match known population totals by age and sex.
9)	Data processing: Data processing procedures (such as edit checks, coding, and validation) are described in the full documentation, including how responses are cleaned and variables are constructed before release. This typically covers a) Data editing for consistency, b) Coding open-ended responses, c) Variable derivations
10)	Data went through rigorous consistency edits to identify logical errors. Imputation (often using the nearest-neighbor method) was used to handle missing data for key variables like income.
11)	Sources of error: Sampling error (due to studying a subset of the population) and non-sampling errors (coverage errors, non-response bias, and respondent recall bias regarding the frequency of volunteering).
12)	Limitations, known biases, etc: a) Rejective Sampling: To ensure enough volunteers were captured, the survey used a "rejective" design where some non-volunteers were sub-sampled and given a shorter interview. This requires careful use of the provided weights to avoid bias. b) Recall Bias: Respondents may over-report "pro-social" behaviors (giving/volunteering) due to social desirability or difficulty recalling exact donation amounts over a 12-month period. c) Geographic Exclusions: The exclusion of the Territories means the data does not represent Canada's North.
13)	Link to documentation and any additional sources used: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/45250011
